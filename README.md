### How I Started my programming Journey

Hey, I'm **Rushan Shaikh**. I started programming when I was in Class XI. My first programming language was Python and currently I am learning C++.

I found programming (Compyter Science) very interesting as we can create things and also I can work on projects which I'd love to do with my friends.

### ABOUT ME :

I love to play basketball/football and also I am interested in theories of physics
